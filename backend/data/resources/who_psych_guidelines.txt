Overview of WHO's Mental Health Work
The World Health Organization (WHO) works to promote mental health and prevent mental, neurological, and substance use disorders. The organization supports expanding access to affordable, quality, and evidence-based treatment and care that aligns with human rights principles. These efforts include developing technical standards, guidance, and tools for interventions that support:


Early child development.

Perinatal mental health.

Mental and brain health of children and adolescents.

People with mental and brain health conditions, addictive behaviors, and substance use disorders.

Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP)
The Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) is a WHO initiative aimed at scaling up services for mental, neurological, and substance use disorders, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. These disorders are highly prevalent, yet many people lack access to the necessary treatment. The mhGAP program asserts that with proper care, psychosocial assistance, and medication, millions of people could be treated for conditions like depression, schizophrenia, and epilepsy, helping them lead normal lives and preventing suicide.



Psychological Interventions
Psychological interventions, also known as psychological treatments or counseling, have proven highly effective for many mental health conditions, especially depression and anxiety. The WHO has published several evidence-based psychological intervention manuals and resources to increase access to this care. These materials are designed for delivery by trained and supervised non-specialists, including community workers, volunteers, and peers. They include approaches for individuals, groups, and guided self-help.



Notable WHO resources for psychological interventions include:


"Doing What Matters in Times of Stress: An Illustrated Guide": A stress management guide for coping with adversity.


"Self-Help Plus (SH+)": A five-session stress management course for large groups.


"Early Adolescent Skills for Emotions (EASE)": A group psychological intervention for 10-15-year-olds with internalizing issues.


"Problem Management Plus (PM+)": Individual and group psychological help for adults impaired by distress.

Mental Health of Children and Adolescents
Childhood and adolescence are critical periods for mental health, as this is when the brain undergoes rapid growth and development. Mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, behavioral disorders, epilepsy, and developmental disabilities are major causes of illness and disability among young people. Globally, 8% of children and 15% of adolescents experience a mental disorder, but most do not seek or receive care. Suicide is the third leading cause of death in 15-29 year-olds.




The WHO supports countries in developing multi-sectoral strategies for mental health promotion and care for children and adolescents. They also collaborated on a five-part 

Caregivers Skills Training (CST) package for families of children with developmental delays or disabilities. The CST program trains caregivers on communication, daily living skills, challenging behaviors, and coping strategies.


Mental Health in Emergencies
Emergency situations like armed conflict, natural disasters, and disease outbreaks significantly increase the risk of mental health conditions. It is estimated that one in five people affected by conflict may have a mental disorder like depression, anxiety, or PTSD. The WHO works globally to provide guidelines, intervention manuals, and policy directions to support mental health and psychosocial responses during emergencies.
